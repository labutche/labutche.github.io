    <h1>Food-Related Outbreaks from 2010-2015: Analysis Summary</h1>
    
    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>This analysis utilizes a dataset comprising food-related outbreaks recorded between 2010 and 2015. The dataset provides critical information needed to understand trends and patterns associated with these outbreaks over time.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Variables</h2>
    <p>A selection of at least five variables from the dataset was used to investigate their potential impact on the research question. These variables were chosen based on their relevance to the study of seasonality and food-borne illnesses.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>The central question guiding this analysis is: <strong>Does seasonality have an impact on when instances of food-borne illnesses occur?</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>The working hypothesis is that seasonality does indeed influence the occurrence of food-borne illnesses. This hypothesis was tested using the selected variables from the dataset.</p>
    
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Through rigorous analysis, the study aimed to determine the validity of the hypothesis. The outcome of the analysis provided insight into the role that seasonality plays in the occurrence of food-borne illnesses, affirming that there is a significant correlation between the two.</p>
