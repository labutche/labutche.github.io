    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Employee attrition, or turnover, is a significant challenge for many organizations, leading to increased costs, loss of productivity, and reduced employee morale. This project aims to predict which employees are likely to leave the organization by using predictive analytics, enabling HR departments to take proactive measures to retain key employees and reduce turnover rates.</p>

    <h2>Business Problem</h2>
    <p>High employee turnover can have a detrimental impact on an organizationâ€™s performance. The costs associated with recruiting, hiring, and training new employees, along with the disruption caused by the loss of experienced staff, make it crucial for organizations to address attrition proactively. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition, providing actionable insights for HR departments.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset">IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/hr-analytics-case-study">HR Analytics Case Study</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These datasets include a wide range of employee attributes, such as age, job role, salary, job satisfaction, and years at the company.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</strong> The data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables. Numerical features were normalized to ensure consistency across the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> EDA was performed to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, helping to identify key factors that influence employee attrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were used to build models that predict the likelihood of employee attrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure their effectiveness in predicting attrition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>The analysis revealed that job satisfaction, years at the company, and salary are significant predictors of employee attrition. Employees with lower job satisfaction, fewer years at the company, and lower salaries were more likely to leave. These insights can help organizations develop targeted retention strategies to reduce turnover.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Based on the findings, it is recommended that HR departments focus on improving job satisfaction and addressing salary concerns to retain valuable employees. Implementing targeted interventions for at-risk employees can further help reduce attrition rates.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p>The project addressed several ethical considerations, including ensuring data privacy, mitigating biases in the data and model, and maintaining transparency in the modeling process. Employee data was anonymized, and efforts were made to ensure that the model did not introduce or exacerbate any biases.</p>

    <h2>Future Applications</h2>
    <p>The predictive model developed in this project can be integrated into HR management systems to continuously monitor employee attrition risk. Additionally, the model could be adapted for other applications, such as predicting employee performance or identifying factors influencing job satisfaction.</p>
