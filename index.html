        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Lauren Butcher, a dedicated and results-driven data scientist and senior commodity analyst with a robust background in biology and data science. My professional journey has been characterized by my passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights and my commitment to continuous improvement in every project I undertake.</p>
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am serving as a Senior Commodity Analyst at Tyson Foods Inc., where I spearhead the enhancement and formulation of comprehensive reports for the commodity procurement and trading divisions. My role involves converting complex raw data into clear, actionable insights, which has resulted in significant cost mitigation, including an annual savings of $25 million. I also played a pivotal role in strategically relocating soybean testing operations to Tyson's Corporate Laboratory, projecting a cost reduction of $1 million annually.</p>
        <p>In addition to my current role, my career at Tyson Foods has included various positions such as Commodity Analyst, Senior Laboratory Microbiologist, and Associate Laboratory Microbiologist. In these roles, I have consistently demonstrated proficiency in executing non-routine processes, conducting comprehensive studies, and standardizing procedures to ensure compliance with food safety standards. I am also adept at guiding and supervising team members to enhance workflow and operational efficiency.</p>
        <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>

            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Proficient in using various data visualization tools to create clear, insightful reports that aid in decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Bellevue University, which I will complete in August 2024, and a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Arkansas, completed in August 2017. My educational background provides a solid foundation in both the scientific and analytical aspects required to excel in data-driven roles.</p>
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in data science. I enjoy working on personal projects that challenge my analytical skills and expand my knowledge in new and innovative ways.</p>
